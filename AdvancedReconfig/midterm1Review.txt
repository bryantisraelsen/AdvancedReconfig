1. UART (Baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity bits, oversampling)
2. Simple processor blocks (what are the necessary parts of the processor, i.e. PC, ALU, etc)
3. DLX Assembly (Register, Immediate, Memory, Jump)
4. DLX Pipeline (FDEMW)
5. Student Presentations
    a. Power PC - (RISC architecture based on DLX hasn't been in production for a while)
        -Developed by AIM (Apple, IBM, Motorola)
    b. MIPS
        - Used in N64
    c. Nios II
        - intel soft core processor 
    d. SmartFusion 2
        - System on chip, (Hard processor (ARM7)), surrounded by FPGA
    e. MicroBlaze
        - AMD (Xilinx) soft core processor
6. Be prepared to write assembly code
7. Be prepared to run assembly code in your head
